## What is a Space Elevator?

A **Space Elevator** is a revolutionary transportation system that consists of:

- A **tether** anchored to Earth's surface and extending into space.
- A **counterweight** in geostationary orbit to balance the tether.
- **Climbers** to transport payloads and people up and down the tether.

This innovative system could dramatically reduce the cost and energy required to access space compared to traditional rockets.
